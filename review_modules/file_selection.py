# File selection logic - we want all unique patient-list combinations to be reviewed with approximately even distribution.
# If a reviewer leaves in the middle of a test, we want them to resume where they left off when they come back
# Reviewers complete one patient-list combination at a time, and then are assigned a different patient and different list.
